    Spiritual Factor - Inner Soul

    (Picture of that innersoul meme)

    Based on picture what have I learned:

    One of the things that I have learned in this module would be the difference of spirituality and religiosity.
    Where the main difference between the two would be spirituality is for an individual and religiosity is 
    communal. I also learned that spirituality does not necessarily mean that you should be part of a religion
    but being part of one could be of great help to developing your spirituality. Spirituality is not necessarily
    an innate ability that one would automatically have. It is an ability that someone would develop overtime as 
    they interact with more people in life which would help them in realizing their purpose in life.

    why is this activity here and how I answered it:

    These pictures are only some of the many pictures that I have as a member of the altar servers of our church.
    It is one way of developing one's spirituality since serving could help you find the meaning and purpose of
    your life, which is to serve God. This is also in a way being religious since religiosity is our adherence to
    a set of values or belief system. Through this ministry I also realized that to fulfill our purpose of serving
    God, we must also learn how to serve others. Serving others is a good way to serve God, since in this sense
    we make the lives of other people easier as we further develop ourselves which is what God also wants. This 
    virtue of serving others, is not a simple task and is something that we must always try to integrate with our lives.
    
    Personal Experience

    Serving as an altar server is in a sense tiring for many. The suppose to be rest day of Sunday of others, becomes
    another daily grind since you also have responsibilities as an altar server of the church. In the first years of 
    becoming one it is in a way discouraging since you sacrifice your rest day to do other tasks. But as years go on
    and your schedule changes into a more acceptable way, and you further develop your list of priorities, being
    an altar server isnt really a big responsibility. It is instead an opportunity, since you get to interact with more 
    people which increases your understanding of how to develop yourself as you find more models for spirituality.

    What changed in me and if nothing changed y not:

    Through serving my sense of responsibility changed. It changed in a sense that before we only take tasks that we 
    think we can do but not the tasks that we are unsure that we can actually do. Through serving, you are tasked by 
    the priests and other officials to do tasks which might seem impossible for you to do since you are new. You may
    fail in doing these tasks but they would keep on trusting you and that would motivate you to keep on trying. 
    Eventually the tasks that seems impossible to complete before is now easy for you to complete.
