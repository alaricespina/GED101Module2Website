    Spiritual Factor - Discovering Life's Meaning

    (Picture of that nakaupo ulit lol)

    Based on picture what have I learned:
    
    Our lives does not have a preset meaning of what must we do for others and what would be our purpose of even living.
    It is our task to find meaning in our lives and if possible to make new meaning out of it. It is sometimes hard for 
    us to find meaning in our lives especially on our hard times, but it is always important to try our best and make the 
    most out of our hard times. It may be too much to say that they would eventually overcome their problems especially 
    to people that seem to have lost their hope in trying to solve their problems. But as someone who hasnt experienced 
    problems that may cause me to become mentally unstable and someone who just keeps on being relaxed despite being faced 
    with great amounts of pressure, I have learned that despite what happens to a person there would always be a way for them
    to come back to their senses and become their best.

    why is this activity here and how I answered it:

    This picture is what I think is the meaning of life. To serve others in a way that would make them feel like it is 
    something that they deserve and in a way that they wouldnt treat your helping of them as an "utang na loob". In this
    picture we can see our renewal and investiture rights of my fellow altar servers, and me as the head calling out their 
    names in the ambo. As the leader of the group I always made it sure for them to get to know how it is like to serve, 
    and tried my best to not force them to serve when they dont want to. I always try to make them feel like they want to 
    serve by letting them pick the schedule they want and not prescribe the schedule for them. I always try to not portray
    myself as a somehow a leader in a sense that I know everything, but I always try to portray myself as someone they could
    just ask what to do and what no to do, and someone that would just watch them.

    Personal Experience:

    As an altar server I have experienced a lot of unexplainable scenarios where even the priests are unsure of what 
    just happened. These scenarios are not easily explained by science either since physics cannot easily translate 
    to the real world even on ideal conditions. These unexplainable scenarios arent necessarily scary and some of them
    could just be a good reminder that we are not alone in this world, at least not in a physical sense. As an altar
    server I have also experienced a lot of things that may not be considered to be acceptable to the church. I have
    seen many officials fighting for what should be done on the church just because it is how they want things to be
    despite not having a reasonable explanation for it nor it being based on the doctrine. These experiences are what 
    further shapes me to know what to do and what not to do and also help me find a better meaning in my life.

    What changed in me and if nothing changed y not:

    Before becoming an altar server I always thought that it is already enough for people to just attend the masses,
    sleep during homily and forget what the priest even talked about on the homily after the mass. I always thought 
    that the mass is just one simple way of celebrating with God and that even if it is higher than other forms of 
    worship it is still almost the same with almost anything since the concept is to just pray and that in this prayer
    you must have an honest conversation with God about the things you want to talk about. Through the help of being
    in this ministry I still think that attending a mass is actually enough for people, but I no longer think that 
    attending is the proper term for it, instead we must celebrate the mass and not just listen to what the priests 
    are saying on the left ear and let it out of the right ear. Instead we must remember that the mass is not just
    a 1 hour celebration of whatever happens, but a way to prepare ourselves for receiving the holy communion, a 
    meaningful way of developing ourselves spiritualy.
