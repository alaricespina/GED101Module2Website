    Spiritual Factor - Connections with Nature

    (Picture)

    Based on picture what have I learned:

    Developing ourselves spirituality does not only mean that we develop ourselves by interacting with other people
    and changing our qualities based on these interactions. Developing ourselves spirituality also means that we
    should try our best to preserve nature and try not to harm it just for the sake of development. In taking care 
    of nature we must not feel like we are pressured to take care of it, we must take care of nature in a sense that
    we want to. In this idea we would be able to preserve nature in a more wholesome manner since we are not forced
    to protect it just because someone told us to. And in preserving nature in a wholesome manner we can develop 
    ourselves in such a way that our actions would also benefit not only the people around us but also the environment.

    why is this activity here and how I answered it:

    This is one of the most recent pictures that I have as a way of showing my connection with Nature. Most of the 
    recent activities that I have such as treeplanting and other environmental activities were done by private
    organizations spearheaded by our church and most of the time I dont take pictures of me planting the trees.
    This picture of Pinsal Falls, in Ilocos Sur is a good way for us to be reminded about our connections with nature.
    There were many tourists before that came here to the same spot where we took a picture, and that causes a lot
    of trash to be improperly disposed. The picture was taken after my family tried to clean the area from the 
    many trash bags and plastic wrappers that some tourists may have left there.

    Personal Experience:

    Personally I am not surprised by the amount of trash that I sometimes see whenver we go to the mountains. Now
    it is natural for me to find few pieces of it just lying around, but this doesnt mean that it is also acceptable.
    Even if it is common now for people to just throw away their trash everywhere, we must still try our best not
    to be like them. Actions that are done by a big group of people doesnt necessarily mean that it is correct. And 
    in this manner as a way of developing ourselves we could start by simply picking up our trash and properly
    segregating or disposing them.

    What changed in me and if nothing changed y not:

    Nothing much changed for me even before I participated in the projects or activities that try to develop our
    environmental awareness. My parents always taught me to try my best not to be a hindrance to others. This may 
    sound like a very broad thing to understand especially for children. And it actually is, but the way that I 
    understood how not to be a hindrance to others would be simply to help others. In helping others you would not
    be a hindrance or is less likely to become one simply because you are trying to help. The same can be said for 
    nature, in order to not be a hindrance to others and to ourselves we must look out for the environment.
