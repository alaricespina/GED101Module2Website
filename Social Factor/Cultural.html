    Social Factor - Cultural Self

    (nakabarong na picture)

    What have I learned:

    In this picture we can see a snapshot of a group performing the karinosa which was suppose to showcase the two couple in a romantic setting. In a sense we should also try to be
    like this in our society, where we live in harmony with the culture present in the society that we belong to. There are also some cases where the commonly accepted value present
    in the society is not something that you are comfortable with but you have to make do. In this lesson I learned that the value accepted by one group to be right may be very wrong
    to other groups and in some cases you have to combine their views in order to have a greater sense of what to do when you are with the groups. In this way we form a harmony 
    between the culture of the groups you belong to along with the values that you believe.

    <Activity>Me Myself and I</Activity>

    Why is this activity included and how I answered it:

    I was very unsure about how I answered this activity since I was confused with the Beliefs, Values and Behaviour of the third column. I answered it in a way that the beliefs and
    values of the second column would be what the group that I stated in the first column exhibited and the BVB in the third column would be what I picked up from the BVB that 
    the group exhibited. This method made it hard to make genuinely different answers from the BVB that the group exhibited since seldom do we pickup values from groups that go
    against them. Most of the time when we join a group, the characteristics that each member has and the behaviour they exhibit is what we also pickup. Having a group that is 
    unproductive would also influence you to become more unproductive and in some unfortunate ways you would be unable to break away from this influence. This activity is also a good
    represetnation of how we learned to develop ourselves based on the society. The activity would tell us how much has our society changed us by asking us about the values that we
    got from the groups that we became members of.

    Personal experience:

    While answering this activity it was kind of nostalgic for me since some of the groups that I included were groups that I have been members of for a very long time. Throughout the
    years I have picked up a lot of different values both good and bad and I had to choose only one from them to include in this activity. It was nostalgic in a sense that for me
    to remember what kind of values would best describe what I got from the group I try to remember what happened throughout these years and how I could summarize those events in one
    quality. 

    What changed:

    In this lesson, not much changed for me since it was mostly a revisit of how society helps us in developing ourselves. In our current stages of life where we all have our own
    agendas, society may not really be much of a factor now. It is still a factor especially in testing what we have learned and seeing if the things we learned actually benefits the
    society. However it is also not much since the things that we have learned before, and how we developed ourselves throughout the early stages of our life greatly contributes to
    how we would take these changes. Developing yourself to grow up in an easy environment where you always get away with passing the exams despite not studying well would make one's
    life harder upon reaching college where one may not even pass the exam especially when they dont study well.
