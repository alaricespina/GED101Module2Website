    Social Factor - Material / Economic Self

    (leonardo di caprio holding his glass of wine)

    What have I learned:

    In this picture we can see one of the famous memes of leonardo di caprio holding a glass of wine celebrating his nomination and victory for the Oscars. In relation to the
    to the lesson that I have learned it asks us to reevaluate ourselves on how we appreciate the things that we have. There are some times where some of our actions and
    perhaps even some of our items would seem to be useless, but in reality it is just our views on how we treat something as useful. In treating some of our possesions as useful
    we might think of other as useless which could be harmful especially when we no longer know the boundaries between our needs and wants. Thats why in this lesson I have also learned
    that those that we consider as useless and worthless are the things that we should consider as meaningful objects. And those that we consider as needs may not always be our needs
    for due to technology and the influence of social media we have blurred the line between things that are essential and non essential.

    <Activity>Wants and Needs</Activity>
    
    Why is this activity here and how did I answer it:

    This activity asks us to reevaluate the things that we currently have and determine if they are truly our needs or they are just our wants. This activity make us reconsider what we 
    set as wants and what we set as needs since this activity also asks us about the use of the items that we listed and its significance. Answering this activity was challenging for me
    since not only did I not have a lot of items to list, most of them could also be considered as wants, and in answering the activity my items considered as wants outnumber the needs,
    6 to 4. It then became a challenge for me to find significance for the wants that I have listed down for wants in life isnt really something that we can find significance in unless it is
    something that would greatly impact our lives.

    Personal experience:

    While answering this activity, I was kind of happy. Happy in a sense that I was given the have these objects and have them play a significant part in my life. Happy in a sense that
    despite not being financially gifted we were able to buy the things that we have, especially the things that we need. I also at the same time felt a little bit of sadness since in 
    listing down the things that I have, I identified a lot of objects that can be categorized as a want. And some of these wants arent necessarily useful to my life at all, these
    wants can be considered as a waste of money, not in a sense that I dont need it at all but in a sense that there are other alternatives of cheaper objects or methods to fill their
    purposes.

    What changed:

    My views on what is essential and non essential changed due to this activity. Having a good idea of what we want and what we need can also help in sorting out your financial problems.
    Knowing the priorities that must be bought and things that could be just handmade or have some other alternatives of not spending money for it, could be very helpful in terms of saving
    and these savings could go a long way in our lives. Knowing the worth of an object is not only limited to their monetary worth but also their significance in our lives. And in knowing
    the sentimental value that an object has I learned to become more appreciative of the things that I have no matter how cheap or expensive they may be.
