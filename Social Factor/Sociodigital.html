    Social Factor - SocioDigital Self

    (image of man with ear phoens in a digital kind of theme)

    What have I learned:

    In this image we can see a man with his headset, colored in a way to show different lines of codes. My interpretation for this image would be a man
    in his digital self, where one may have a different way of expressing themselves in social media platforms than when they do in real life. In this lesson
    I have learned that there is a tendency for people to have different ways of expressing themselves in social media and in real life for I also have this
    kind of tendency. This difference in their ways of expressing themsleves in social media and in real life is not helpful for the development of theirselves
    since having different ways of expression could gather different crowds that would make you interact with them which might not be helpful especially if the
    crowds that invite you are opposites of each other. Having this conflict of which group you belong to also makes you reevaluate more about yourself on who
    you really are which could also lead to a deeper understanding or in worse cases more confusion as to who you really are.

    <Activity>The social digital self, My social media</Activity>

    Why is this here and How I answered:

    Answering this activity was kind of hard for me since, I dont really post a lot in my social media accounts and only use them to chat with other people
    especially with my groupmates. This means that my posts wouldnt really be about namecalling, ranting and other toxic behavior just like what others do
    when they are in a bad mood on social media. I think that this activity is also worthwhile in evaluating how we develop our sociodigital self, since it
    asks us to reevaluate what we have posted and if the things we have posted are actually toxic or not. Knowing what we post and reflecting what and why
    we posted it could help us determine if that was the right thing to do at that time.

    Personal experience:

    While answering this activity it also felt nostalgic since I had to scroll all the way back to 2005 when I was still posting minecraft pictures. Most of
    the posts that I have on my feed are just me being tagged by people on pictures and probably the occassional posts required by my teachers before when I
    was doing their projects while I was on grade school. It didnt help that the things that I post were so few, but at the same time it was also helpful since
    it only shows that I always try to make the posts as good as possible in a sense that it wont start fights or other misunderstandings.

    What changed:

    Not much of me has changed after answering this activity since I am not really that active when it comes to posting in social media. I prefer to talk to people
    discuss the topics within them, and it would be up to them if they want to share it on their walls or wherever they want. I prefer to address the problems
    that I have with the people directly and not on wall, namecalling them and giving indirect insults which I think is unnecessary. I think this activity would
    be a very good checkpoint for everyone of us to see if the things we posted were actually worthwhile, and if they actually reflect us in our offline world,
    becuase that is what I think should be the point of developing ourselves. Even if we interact with people online we should not forget ourselves offline since
    it is who we are before the internet came to be and who will be even if the lights go out.
