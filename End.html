        overall experience in Module 2

        For me my overall experience was that this module was a complex yet understandable module, it had many
        different theories regarding the different factors that affect the development of oneself. Overall my
        experience on this module was great, and there was a chance for all groups to present a certain topic 
        assigned to them which was a good way of reflecting on the different modules tackled.
