        overall experience in Module 2

        For me my overall experience was that this module was a complex yet understandable module, it had many
        different theories regarding the different factors that affect the development of oneself. Overall my
        experience on this module was great, and there was a chance for all groups to present a certain topic 
        assigned to them which was a good way of reflecting on the different lesson tackled.

        The module was overall great and even if there were some topics that were not easy to understand at first
        a few readings of the same topic would be very helpful in the comprehension of such topic

        what are the things/topics/activities that you liked or liked less. 

        All the topics, and activities were enjoyable and had evident reasons as to why they were tasked for us to 
        do especially this digital portfolio which would help us to further create our insights on our developing
        self. There is an activity pertaining to the sexual self that made many, not only me , of my classmates also
        unconfortable since it is a very rare ocassion for one to ask about such personal matters. I think it is 
        still a need since even if we dont share the actual answers to the questions the virtue of trying to regulating
        and not easily falling to temptation in order to control our desires is still there
