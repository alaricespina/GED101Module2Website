    Mental Factor - Cognition, Memory and Intelligence

    (image of man with modern problems requires modern solution)

    What have I learned:

    Just like what it is stated in the picture of above or what was commonly accepted as a meme of solving problems in a very unusual way yet works in a
    very unpredictable and unexplainable way. I have learned in this lesson the importance of developing ourselves mentally. Mentally developing ourselves
    is natural but unlike other factors that depend merely on how the environment would treat you and how you would take in that treatment, mentally developing
    ourselves require a lot of hardwork and dedication. We dont just become mentally strong by having an environment that would constantly bring us down no
    matter how hard we try, we become mentally strong by having the will to become one and trying to persevere to become one despite all the challenges. This
    also leads me to a learning that developing ourselves mentally does not also stop with us just developing ourselves but also in trying to understand others.
    Mentally developing yourself also gives you an idea on how people would also mentally develop themselves, having the same situation of, trying to prove that
    you are someone that can change despite your environment always bringing you down, with someone else would make you sympathize them or try to encourage them
    to not give up and also find other ways to help them.

    <Activity>Multiple intelligence</Activity>

    Why is this here and how I answered it:

    In order to answer this activity, I first had to take a multiple intelligence test on the provided link. There were a lot of questions for the 
    multiple intelligence test, yet many of them were just repeating questions mainly for consistency. Most of the answers in this activity are interpretations 
    of the score that I got from the multiple intelligence test. In this way we are able to process the score we got and realize how our multiple intelligence 
    would be put to use. Interpreting how we would be able to use our multiple intelligence would be essential in developing ourselves mentally. The multiple
    intelligence test would give us an idea on the things that we are bad at and the things that we are good at. This would make us realize that we need to 
    spend more time developing certain aspects in our life particularly the weaknesses that was shown by the test.

    Personal experience:

    Answering the multiple intelligence survey was very annoying for my part, since most of the questions there were just repetitive quesitons and paraphrased
    versions of the other previous questions. It makes sense for me that they were doing it for the sake of consistency but I think there are other ways or other
    methods to rephrase the wording of the questions for the consistency. In answering the activity from the book, I didnt really feel happy nor sad, it was more of
    just the same feeling everyday, like as if I was used to answering this kind of questions. It felt like an ordinary day to day survey of how are you doing, and
    a reevaluation of what you did yesterday, it felt normal.

    What changed:

    One of the things that changed after answering the activity would be the way that I treat my "intelligence". I always thought that on personality type tests and other
    tests that evaluate yourself and how you do compared to others, you must focus on trying to improve the things that you are bad on. After answering this activity, I
    think more about the things that I already am good at. As stated by the test, I was good at spatial intelligence and logical intelligence and bad at interpersonal
    relationships. The natural response would be to spend more time building relationships with others and developing interpersonal intelligence. But after this acitivty
    I think its better if I try and improve more on my spatial intelligence and logical intelligence along with the things that Im bad at. For me we shouldnt just focus
    on one part, instead of trying to fix the things you are bad at, just continue on what you are doing and in time it would also develop, without having to exert so
    much more effort that would sacrifice other aspects of your life.
