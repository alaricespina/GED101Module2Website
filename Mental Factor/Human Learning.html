    Mental Factor - Human Learning

    (Picture of the brain with many plugs of usb ports connected towards it)

    What have I learned:

    Seen in this picture is a brain with several usb connected to it. Originally this picture is about how machine learning helps us to think deeper but this picture
    can also relate to the consequences that our actions have which also leads us to learning. Learning is not always desired, sometimes learning comes from moments
    which we wished to forget or not experienced. Just like the many usb ports connected to the brain, our learning comes from many different sources and would have 
    different effects on how we develop. Some of us may have learned a lot from our parents since we spent most of our time with them as we grew up, while some might
    not have since their parents were always busy with work and had less time with them. It is also notable in the picture that the wires of the usb cables are not 
    really organized and seems like they were just randomly placed there to later on become tangled. This shows that our learning does not always come as planned and
    it may affect the learnings that we get. No matter how tangled they may be and how random some of our learnings may become there would always be a lesson in it, that
    we should learn to appreciate.

    <Activity>Powerpoint on the CMI</Activity>

    Why is this here and how I answered it:

    This powerpoint was suppose our powerpoint presentation for the cognition, memory and intelligence, but it is one good way of showing my understanding of Human
    Learning. Since Human learning is about how we would learn through some of the activities that we do, we could also relate it to cognition, memory and intelligence.
    Through this powerpoint presentation we were able to learn more about the topic through observational learning which was specified in the social cognitive theory.
