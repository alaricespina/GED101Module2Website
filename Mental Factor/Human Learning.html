    Mental Factor - Human Learning

    (Picture of the brain with many plugs of usb ports connected towards it)

    What have I learned:

    Seen in this picture is a brain with several usb connected to it. Originally this picture is about how machine learning helps us to think deeper but this picture
    can also relate to the consequences that our actions have which also leads us to learning. Learning is not always desired, sometimes learning comes from moments
    which we wished to forget or not experienced. Just like the many usb ports connected to the brain, our learning comes from many different sources and would have 
    different effects on how we develop. Some of us may have learned a lot from our parents since we spent most of our time with them as we grew up, while some might
    not have since their parents were always busy with work and had less time with them. It is also notable in the picture that the wires of the usb cables are not 
    really organized and seems like they were just randomly placed there to later on become tangled. This shows that our learning does not always come as planned and
    it may affect the learnings that we get. No matter how tangled they may be and how random some of our learnings may become there would always be a lesson in it, that
    we should learn to appreciate.

    <Activity>Powerpoint on the CMI</Activity>

    Why is this here and how I answered it:

    This powerpoint was suppose our powerpoint presentation for the cognition, memory and intelligence, but it is one good way of showing my understanding of Human
    Learning. Since Human learning is about how we would learn through some of the activities that we do, we could also relate it to cognition, memory and intelligence.
    Through this powerpoint presentation we were able to learn more about the topic through observational learning which was specified in the social cognitive theory.


    Personal Experience:

    Presenting this powerpoint gave us good insights on how we should learn. One could just use a normal script and read all of the contents of the slide. This way 
    there would be no stutters and there could be an obvious cohesiveness between the members since everything is scripted. On the other hand, you could also present
    without a script, and do an impromptu but there might be stutters yet you are presenting from your understanding. These two methods can be compared to the different
    kinds of learning, such as surface and deep learning. The surface learning can be compared to the reading of a script when presentation, since you only memorized 
    the things you want to say but may not have had a deep understanding of the lesson, and would still be rigid when asked questions regarding the understanding of the 
    presentation. The deep learning can on the other hand can be compared to presenting in an impromptu way since when you do an impromptu, you dont necessarily have
    to take a script and read it while presenting, instead you just read certain parts of the presentation and certain parts of your memory would be recalled which
    would help you to further present the topic.

    What changed:

    Nothing much changed for me since learning for me is not something that could be done in an easy manner, unless you have photographic memory and could memorize
    anything you see immediately. For me learning is something we must all practice as we live our lives since the topics and problems we would face would not be
    an easy one and requires very deep understanding to provide accurate solutions. I also think that through this lesson we are further encouraged to think things
    in a more unusual way since usually the solutions to problems and the way we understand these problems can be explained outside of traditional methods.
