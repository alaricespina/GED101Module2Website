                In this picture we can see a person just staying chill, someone that doesnt look like he has problems in his life, and someone that would probably do the right thing in tight
                situations. This is the lesson that I have learned in the activity, to always try and solve problems and answer questions in your life in a cool headed way. Doing it in this
                way would help you in possibly looking for better ways to answer a question and a more practical way of solving the problem. It is a hard thing to do but mastering this kind 
                of problem solving would be very essential especially in moments where people tend to stick with their emotions and not with their minds.

            <p>
                As someone who is very new to this university and is yet to know what kind of teachers exist here, I always try my best to be conservative on my answers. I answered the
                questions in a way that my experiences and other personal information would not be revealed too much but at the same time I am still able to answer the questions. This
                activity is also a good way of testing our development in terms of the sexual development especially since it asks the questions straight to the point such as our 
                confusions regarding this topic. In stating those confusions and reviewing them again after a certain period of time, those confusions that we stated here later on 
                become points to ponder and become inspirations for us to find deeper answer to those confusions.

            <p>
            While answering this activity, I felt very awkward, probably the most awkward time I ever had in this class. 
            It was very new for me for a professor to even ask about these kind of things since in my previous school despite our professors reading everyone of us like a book they still
            like to had those kinds of grey areas for them to discover later on.

                <h1>What changed?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
            One of the things that changed within me would be the way that I answer my assesments. Prior to finishing this activity I just put whatever answer I can think of once I read
            the question and instructions. After the activity I try to be more concise and try to remove unnecessary parts of my answer that wouldnt really contribute in answering
            the question.
