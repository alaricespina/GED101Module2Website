    Biological Factor - Physical Self

    (Picture of that weird ass skeleton)

    Based on picture what have I learned:

    In this lesson, one important factor for the development of ourselves would be our physical bodies. Without it
    we simply wouldnt be here, since it is what we need to interact with other physical beings and objects. It is 
    therefore important to take care of our body in order to further develop ourselves. In this picture we can see 
    a skeleton and what seems to be a snapshot of from an anatomy class. This picture can also be a representation 
    that under the thick skin and other things that we put on our bodies, we are all the same. In this sense since
    we are all the same then it is much more simpler for us to take care of ourselves, since people are able to 
    understand the things we need and could also offer help in a way that would help us develop ourselves.

    <activity>Factors of Myself-Individual</activity>

    Why is this activity here and how I answered it:

    This activity is a tabulation of the things that influences us the most in our growing up. It tasks us to rank 
    how the society, our environment, our parents and how we influenced ourselves to have the certain traits that 
    we have right now. This activity is a great way of looking back to how we got our traits and the second part 
    of this activity which was a tabulation of our other group members is also another great way of knowing the 
    difference that we have as we grew up. Knowing how we grew up and how we differ from others could give us an idea
    on how we might able to cope up with their indifferences by simply looking at their background and knowing how 
    they grew up and got this trait.

    Personal Experience:

    Answering this activity was peculiar for me since you get to compare your way of growing up with other members 
    which in itself is something that I dont usually do. I usually dont think that someone should compare how one
    grows to another for no good reason since the way they grew up might be becaues of a different context as to 
    how you grew up. It is an overall new experience for me to have groupmates that grew up in different ways, and 
    have different factors that may have caused their way of growing up. 

    What changed in me and if nothing changed y not:

    My view of how people grew up is probably the thing that changed in me the most. It was customary for me to 
    have almost the same background for every people I meet since in my previous school, which is having a stable
    family, with both parents working and is able to eat 3x a day for many years. Some of the students that I had 
    become in contact with no longer have parents, some died and some are seperated, which caused them to adapt 
    certain cultures and different ways of growing, evident in the factors that they have stated that lead them 
    to having such traits.
