    Emotional Factor - Emotitonal Intelligence

    (The picture with many different feelings portrayed in a box)

    Based on picture what have I learned:

    So in this picture we can see a lot of different facial expressions grouped together in boxes. This picture only
    shows a part of the many different emotions that we might feel, yet these emotions are also very powerful in a 
    sense that it can change the course of our lives by affecting the way we decide on things, especially on moments
    where the decisions might be too much for us to handle. I also learned that in this lesson knowing your emotions
    and acting appropriately based on it , would give us a better way of coping with the stresses in our lives since 
    not only do we understand why we feel this way on certain situations, we also become more aware of what should
    we do to feel better and become less stressed.

    why is this activity here and how I answered it:

    This activity is a reflection on a reading regarding how an academic definition of emotional inteligence and how
    it can be measured in a standardized way. The reading gave us more insight regarding models that may represent 
    emotional intelligence and why some of these models are preffered over others. Answering this activity is a straightforward
    task since we would only state the things that we have learned, but it is also a great way in helping us remember
    the things we read. This activity made it possible for me to view emotional intelligence in a more objective way
    and less into a subjective view where everything can be correct given the correct context.

    Personal Experience:

    Answering this activity was in a way stressful since the reaading was not that short, but that stress was not distress
    but rather eustress. Eustress is a kind of stress that is still stressful but it is for the benefit of the one that 
    would be stressed. Answering this activity made me stressed since I have to think again about the different methods 
    that were mentioned and try to point out inconcsitencies in a well organized paper. This is a very hard task to do 
    especially if the paper was approved by experts since I am not an expert on this field. I still tried my best and answered
    this activity but nonetheless it is stressful.

    What changed in me and if nothing changed y not:

    One of the things that changed in me would be the way that I interpret emotional intelligence. Before doing this 
    activity I was always thinking about emotional intelligence in a way that it is purely subjective and that there 
    is no right or wrong emotion for a current situation given the different context that we all have. After doing this 
    activity I realized that there is a criteria for what is the right and wrong emotion for a certain situation.
    One cannot just simply become happy when someone else dies, because that would be a celebration for someone passing
    away and leaving all thier loved ones sad and incomplete.
