    Emotional Factors - Emotional Regulation

    (Picture of the hand and brain and heart on a scale)

    Based on picture what have I learned:

    We can see in this picture a hand holding a makeshift scale balancing the brain and the heart. The heart can be
    a representation of our emotions and the brain is a simple representation of our cognitive abilities, our multiple
    intelligence. It is important to balance the two in a way that we use our emotional intelligence in interacting
    with others while using our cognitive abilities to help out with sorting our emotions especially in decisions 
    which could change our lives forever. This balance is not only important for the development of oneself but also
    in order to not harm and try to benefit others. Being emotional intelligent and constantly keeping our emotions in 
    check would make it possible for other people to be happy around us since they know that in times of need you would 
    be dependable and would act in a rational way, not in a way that would only act because of the pressures that you 
    would feel.

    why is this activity here and how I answered it:

    This activity is in a way a method for us to regulate our emotions. It is a way of evaluating our previous actions
    in order to know if these actions can be considered rational, or just purely emotional. This would be helpful in 
    determining whether we did the right thing in that situation or just went with how we felt and may have caused further
    damage to other people. Answering this activity was slightly nostalgic, since I have done some of the activities mentioned
    but not a lot of them, even if experiencing these activities, I have only done it a few times. It was in a way hard for 
    me to answer since I couldnt really relate to these situations

    Personal Experience:

    Personally since I havent experienced much of these situations I had to ask for my friends to give me an idea on how
    it feels to be in such situations. It felt weird trying to get in the shoes of some people that seems to be pessimistic
    on how the world treats them. A simple prank on them could mean that they were being bullied and that they think that 
    it should be a basis for treating others differently. For me this isnt really the way that pranks should be understood,
    yes there may be some pranks that are out of bounds but the simplest way of interpreting these pranks would be 
    returning the favor to them in order to stand on equal grounds with them. In a way while answering these activities it
    was kind of werid but at the same times it was also full of new experiences. 

    What changed in me and if nothing changed y not:

    After answering these acitvities I could say that not much changed for me. I always try my best to take things in a very
    relaxed way, even the stressful tests for some people are just a way for me to relax as well. I view things in a way that 
    there is no need to get stressed since if I get too stressed in trying to do things, then I have no reason of doing it in 
    the first place. I always belived that the things we need to do should only give us Eustress as well and not Distress since
    the things that we need would benefit us, which we  should be happy of or somehow relaxed in doing in order to keep your cool
    and not get too involved in doing the activity that you forget other things.
